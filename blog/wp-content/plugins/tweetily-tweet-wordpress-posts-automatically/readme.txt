== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why is this plugin free?

-Ok, maybe you weren't thinking that. But let me tell you anyway. That's the spirit of the Internet. We contribute and make it a better place. If the Wordpress folks can release this awesome blog platform for free, the least I can do is contribute to make it the best blogging platform EVER!

-I don't charge for this. I don't ask for donations. BUT...you can contribute with a TWITTER FOLLOW! Pretty please?!


I can't authorize to Twitter! What gives?

-Copy the URL address on your browser into the Tweetily Admin URL box, then update settings, then try to authorize again.

-If that doesn't work, let me know! http://www.themana.gr/tweetily-tweet-wordpress-post-automatically/


Can I have more than one Twitter account connected?

-Right now, it's just supporting one Twitter account OAuth is tough enough with just one account, let alone two! Ahh!


Can I post more than one item at a time?

-Absolutely! You can select to tweet up to 10 posts at a time! WOW!


But what about if I REALLY want to post more than 10 items? Can I do that?

-More than 10? Are you nuts? This is borderline spamming your Twitter following! 

-It's not recommended...BUT...if you really want to, on your Wordpress Dashboard, click PLUGINS > EDITOR > select TWEETILY > click on the file TOP-CORE.PHP, find the line $as_number_tweet = 10; and change the number 10 to the maximum number of tweets you want.


Wow, just like that? 

-Yes, just like that. But I'll caution you. Twitter limits you to only certain number of tweet actions per time period so you'll be close to hitting your limit. Hitting the limit is a red flag. There, I've said it. I'm done.


Do you have plans to add more to this?

-You bet I do! I'm actually taking input from people on features, changes, etc. Really anything that would make it better. Just contact me and let me know.
